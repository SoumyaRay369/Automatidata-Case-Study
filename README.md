This Repository tracks the progress across 3 projects that were given to me as part of the Google Advanced Analytics Course on Coursera. 

I have tried to go along with all the three projects as that gives me more experience.

**I hope that this endeavour will give me a lot of expertise on basic EDA in the beginning and then later on Machine Learning.**

> ***I also want to note that from time to time I have also added Case Studies that were provided in the course, which were not meant to analysed in so much depth, but I did that anyway. One example that I am really proud of is the Unicorn_Companies Analysis.***
